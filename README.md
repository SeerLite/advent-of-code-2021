All Python programs use Python version 3.8.2 unless otherwise stated. I am aware that in Python 3.9 and forward there are nicer typing hints, but sadly my current Guix installation only has up to 3.8.2 and I don't think I can get a newer version without recompiling yet.

### Dec 1
* Python because that's what I know best

### Dec 4
* Starting from day 3, I'm doing all challenges in Guile Scheme until it gets too hard or I want to focus on coding speed.

### Dec 13
* PDT season is over so I can finally focus on this. I'm going back to Python to try to catch up.
* I've been writing a little TypeScript lately so I missed the type hints. I set up a primitive mypy environment for day 4 and the experience has been great. I might continue like this.
