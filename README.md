All Python programs require Python version 3.9 or higher, unless otherwise stated.

### Dec 1
* Python because that's what I know best

### Dec 4
* Starting from day 3, I'm doing all challenges in Guile Scheme until it gets too hard or I want to focus on coding speed.

### Dec 13
* PDT season is over so I can finally focus on this. I'm going back to Python to try to catch up.
* I've been writing a little TypeScript lately so I missed the type hints. I set up a primitive mypy environment for day 4 and the experience has been great. I might continue like this.

### Dec 14
* Day 6 is a sneaky one. I'll leave part 2 for tomorrow.

### Dec 15
* I updated from Python 3.8.2 to 3.9.6. Yay typing!

## Dec 17
* Finally completed day 6 part 2. That was the hardest one yet, and I'm still not completely sure about the math I set up in there but it works! And it's fast! I'm so proud of myself :)
* I went to read the more popular solutions on /r/adventofcode and now I feel incredibly stupid for not figuring their way (by working with the counts of the fishes). Well, I guess that's a lesson on thinking a little more outside the box. Still proud of my solution :) Only saw one other that did it similarly (though unlike me they actually knew what they were doing)
